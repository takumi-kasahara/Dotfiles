# C# for PowerShell

- Generate a C# source file that can be loaded by PowerShell 7.6 `Add-Type`.
- The goal is for `Add-Type -Path '<file>.cs'` to succeed in compilation and loading.

## Guidelines

1. Constraint priority:
	- First: .NET 10 API compatibility.
	- Second: PowerShell 7.6 `Add-Type` compilation compatibility.
	- Third: minimal namespace usage.
2. If the request depends on unsupported APIs or features, explain the limitation and suggest a compatible alternative.
3. Generate C# source containing `public class` or `public static class`.
4. Include only namespaces that are actually used by the generated code.
	- Start with `using System;` when needed.
	- Common examples: `System`, `System.IO`, `System.Collections.Generic`.
